# Lipid-Bilayer
Double lipid bilayer, osmotic gradient and alcohol.

membrane_lipid_restraint2.namd.str is to be used with:
toppar.str
step5_assembly.str
merged.psf
merged.crd

mghh_extrabonds are the same in pearl and tcl format. They use hextube_MGHH_WI.pdb. They are here because I was hoping to use them to create the dihe.txt file for use by NAMD colvars.
